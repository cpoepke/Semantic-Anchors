## 📖 What are Semantic Anchors?

Semantic anchors are **well-defined terms, methodologies, or frameworks** that act as shared vocabulary between humans and LLMs. They trigger specific, contextually rich knowledge domains within an LLM's training data.

### Examples

- **"TDD, London School"** → Activates: outside-in testing, mock-heavy approach, interaction-based verification
- **"Clean Architecture"** → Activates: Uncle Bob's layered design, dependency rule, use cases as center
- **"SOLID Principles"** → Activates: S.O.L.I.D. breakdown, object-oriented design patterns

### Why Use Them?

- **Precision** - Reduce ambiguity by referencing established knowledge
- **Efficiency** - Activate complex frameworks with minimal tokens
- **Consistency** - Ensure LLMs interpret concepts as the community intends
- **Context Compression** - Convey rich context concisely

## 🤖 Installation for Coding Agents

For the widest compatibility, install anchors into a project-level `AGENTS.md` first, then add agent-specific mirrors only where the official docs say they help.

### Portable Baseline (Recommended)

Use the bundled installer to inject the managed anchor block into the best available project instruction file. If none exists yet, it creates `AGENTS.md`.

```bash
./skill/semantic-anchor-onboarding/scripts/install.sh \
  --source skill/semantic-anchor-onboarding/assets/templates/anchor-block.md \
  --target-dir . \
  --scope project
```

### [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/)
Codex supports `AGENTS.md` for repository instructions.
- Keep shared semantic anchors in `AGENTS.md`.
- Use this as the canonical file when you want the same anchors to work across multiple agents.

### [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory)
Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` for project memory and also supports hooks.
- **Static Context:** Mirror the same anchor block into `CLAUDE.md` if Claude Code is a target.
- **Optional Hook:** If you want Claude to re-inject the managed block at session start, run:
  ```bash
  ./skill/semantic-anchor-onboarding/scripts/install.sh \
    --source skill/semantic-anchor-onboarding/assets/templates/anchor-block.md \
    --target-dir . \
    --scope project \
    --claude-hook
  ```

### [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
Current Gemini CLI docs center on `GEMINI.md` and configurable context file names.
- **Native Gemini Context:** Mirror your selected anchors into `GEMINI.md`.
- **Shared Cross-Agent Context:** Set Gemini's `context.fileName` to `AGENTS.md` if you want one portable project file.
- Current Gemini CLI docs no longer describe `.gemini/skills/` or `gemini skills link` as the primary path for always-on instructions.

### [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules)
Cursor supports `AGENTS.md` and project rules in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for shared, repo-wide semantic anchors.
- Use `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` only when you need path-scoped or feature-scoped behavior inside Cursor itself.

### [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)
Copilot supports repository instruction files, and its coding agent can also consume `AGENTS.md`.
- Create or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` when you want the same anchors to influence Copilot chat and review flows.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` as the shared baseline if other coding agents are also in use.

### [Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/memories)
Windsurf supports `AGENTS.md` alongside Windsurf Rules.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for portable project context shared with other agents.
- Use Windsurf Rules only when you need editor-specific or scoped behavior.
